                results…

                Well, I have always been training with Marina, and when I found out about
                program I was very curious and intrigued by it, I thought I’d give it a chance 
                and see if I can finally get the results I’ve been trying to achieve (healthier 
                and fitter body).
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, the biggest doubt I had was how I could be eating as much as I am 
                and not actually gain from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hardest thing in the beginning was cutting out the sauces and oily food 
                that I was used to. It has effected me by showing that I can still ( kind of ) 
                eat the same things but just replace the bad ingredients with good ones, 
                and that is really not hard at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve just finished 1 month of the program and my results are amazing. I’ve 
                lost 4kg and 4,4% of fat and I’m not longer always bloated as I was used to. 
                It feels absolutely amazing to see yourself in the mirror, knowing you 
                achieved your goals and that you can actually continue living like this for 
                the rest of your life without missing the way you used to live (and eat) 
                before.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have really become so much more confident with myself and I believe 
                anyone could do it too…….and….I wish you can see my pictures :)

                I have been always conscious for my weight and health. However because
                of lack of follow ups I had wrong habits of eating which eventually effected 
                my body form. After one month of Big Triumph program my lifestyle 
                changed. My body shape changed in this short period of time and it all 
                boosted my confidence and inspiration.

                I have been training with Marina for the past few years and have found her
                sessions to be extremely effective. She has always been dedicated to 
                helping people to achieve their goals with regard to improving their 
                physique and facilitating healthy eating habits.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept behind Big Triumph is that entire family can be healthy and be 
                fit together. Marina makes sure that everyone is committed to following 
                the program and is completely certain they will be happy with the result. 
                Fitness goals, recipes, and guidelines are provided and she and her dietitian 
                can always be reached should there be any questions and concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought I was following fairly healthy diet in the past, although there were 
                definitely times when I overindulged a bit. I don’t feel guilty about it, I just 
                generally enjoy myself while trying to maintain as healthy a diet as possible 
                on a fairy consistent basis. I know now, that even when I was eating well 
                and eating all the right foods, I was eating certain foods at the wrong time 
                of day with the wrong combination, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now my husband and I are following Marina’s plan at Big Triumph. I have to 
                say that combining training and implementation of appropriate food 
                combinations has really helped us to lose weight where we needed to, 
                maintain appropriate weight distribution, decrease body fat and in general 
                just feel much better. I feel much more energetic every morning. Feelings 
                of being too full or being bloated are virtually gone. There is even room for 
                indulgence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Big Triumph is an excellent program, run by people who are dedicated to 
                their concept. I’m glad to be a part of it!

                One month after joining Big Triumph, I can say that I really enjoyed my diet
                and exercise program. I recommend everyone to start it since I did see 
                massive result in just one month. The best part of the program was that I 
                enjoyed the whole process. Diet and exercise go hand in hand and for the 
                team to monitor both at the same time is exactly why I chose Big Triumph 
                and I have to say they exceeded my expectations. In just one month I lost 
                4,3% fat and my body shape changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have learned to live a new and much healthier lifestyle thanks to Big 
                Triumph.
